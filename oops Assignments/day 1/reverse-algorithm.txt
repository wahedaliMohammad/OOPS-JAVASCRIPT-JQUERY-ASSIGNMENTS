step 1: start
step 2: input nNum from the user and declare a variable called rem
step 3: Read nNum
step 4: initialise rev=0
step 5: While nNum is greater than or equal to 1 go to step 6
step 6: calculate rem = nNum % 10
step 7: calculate rev = (10 * rev) + rem
step 8: compute nNum =nNum/10
step 9: return rev value
step 10: display the reverse digit,rev
step 11: end
